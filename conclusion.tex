\section{Summary}
In this thesis we described our design and implementation of Bloc - a library for handling large binary objects.
We also describe how our design achieves concurrency without using any locks.

\section{Future Work}
Currently our code uses several functions which are supported only on POSIX.
This means that our library will not work on Windows. In future, we might look
into adding support for Windows.

We are also working on creating a key-value store like Bitcask. We plan to add support for storing \texttt{BlobIds} provided by our library as a value in the key-value store.
