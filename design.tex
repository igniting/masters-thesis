We store all the large objects in separate files. All the large objects of a database are stored under a single directory which we also call a ``BlobStore''.
The BlobStore contains three subdirectories: \textit{tmp}, \textit{curr} and \textit{old}. \textit{old} directory is used during garbage collection, which we will discuss later.
