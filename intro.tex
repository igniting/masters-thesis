Database refers to a collection of information that exists overs a long period of time. A Database Management System (DBMS) is a tool for creating and managing large amount of data efficiently. Early database management systems evolved from file systems. These database systems used tree-based and the graph-based models for describing the structure of the information in a database. Database systems changed significantly following a famous paper written by Ted Codd in 1970~\cite{codd1970relational}. Codd proposed that database systems should present the user with a view of data organized as tables called relations.
